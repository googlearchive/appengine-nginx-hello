Getting Started
===============

If you haven't already make sure you are familiar with Custom Runtimes in the
App Engine Managed VM documentation.

You must have the Google Cloud SDK, with the Managed VM component installed.
We will assume that the SDK is available on your command line as `$ gcloud`.

You must also [install
Docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/#installation) on your
workstation, as the SDK uses it to build, test and deploy your application.

What's in this Repository?
==========================

This is a minimal managed VM runtime that runs the nginx server.  It
implements the two required handlers (`/_ah/start` and `/_ah/health`) as
static pages and illustrates the files necessary to run a custom runtime.

+ `app.yaml` - Configuration file for App Engine.
+ `Dockerfile` - Defines your docker image.
+ `www/index.html` - Root page to be served by nginx.
+ `nginx.conf` - nginx configuration file.
+ `ok` - File content served by start and health handlers.

Running Locally
===============

First, make sure Docker has been started on your workstation.  Refer to the
Managed VM documentation for more information on how to do this for your
environment.

Then, to run locally:

  `$ gcloud preview app run /path/to/appengine-nginx-hello`

This will build the nginx docker image and run it locally.  You can access it
at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

Deploying your Application
==========================

To deploy to App Engine:

  `$ gcloud preview app deploy /path/to/appengine-nginx-hello`

This will build the nginx docker image and deploy it to App Engine.

Serving Static Files
====================

You can use this demo to serve static files from a managed vm.  Just add files
to the www directory and they'll be added to the /usr/share/nginx/www
directory and served from your app.
